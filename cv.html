<!-- The Audio file (mp3) that I used is an Unlicensed mp3 (bensound-rumble.mp3) that i downloaded from
http://http://www.bensound.com/ . I put this on my page as a background music with the use of the default
HTML5 player and the attributes of autoplay in order to start on the background automatically during the time
that it takes for my page to load fully, plus loop in order to play nonstop (for those who enjoy the specific song).
I did use the ID of "bg_music" on the <audio> tag because I am planning to put some extra effort if <br>
there is time and give the use the ability to pause/stop the music with some buttons somewhere on site.
For now, since there are no buttons either, I have the hidden="true" in order to just make it invisible on
page. -->

<!-- I use the IMG html tag, with the characteristics of the class "logo" in order to set an image on the
top of my page as the logo of my website, and in order to make it look more like a "website logo" i created
an IMG class named as "logo" on my CSS and added few cool characteristics as the "border-radius: 50%;" so that
it adds that circle cut effect (that could alternativly do on an Image Editor and save the "around the circle"
area as a transparent background. I also added the position relative attribute in order to be able to use a 2nd
CSS rule and put a text (as a Welcome text in the beggining, then changed my mind and replaced it with just a
"website title"). I did this because i wanted to achieve to put the text ON TOP of the image in order to make it 
look like a real website logo. -->

<p class="big">my Curriculum Vitae.</p><br />
<p>I had the passion about computers and coding since 1987 when i did my first steps in the IT field as a young developer by experimenting with coding on different languages without anyone's help, trying to create things to use on my computer on my own. It didn't make me rich but helped me see what I was meant to be working on as an adult. Adaptable to new technologies and committed to the dream of becoming the very best Developer world wide, I further decided to enroll on an amazing University and find my way into knowledge by asking questions to those who actually know.</p>
