<!-- The Audio file (mp3) that I used is an Unlicensed mp3 (bensound-rumble.mp3) that i downloaded from
http://http://www.bensound.com/ . I put this on my page as a background music with the use of the default
HTML5 player and the attributes of autoplay in order to start on the background automatically during the time
that it takes for my page to load fully, plus loop in order to play nonstop (for those who enjoy the specific song).
I did use the ID of "bg_music" on the <audio> tag because I am planning to put some extra effort if <br>
there is time and give the use the ability to pause/stop the music with some buttons somewhere on site.
For now, since there are no buttons either, I have the hidden="true" in order to just make it invisible on
page. -->

<!-- I use the IMG html tag, with the characteristics of the class "logo" in order to set an image on the
top of my page as the logo of my website, and in order to make it look more like a "website logo" i created
an IMG class named as "logo" on my CSS and added few cool characteristics as the "border-radius: 50%;" so that
it adds that circle cut effect (that could alternativly do on an Image Editor and save the "around the circle"
area as a transparent background. I also added the position relative attribute in order to be able to use a 2nd
CSS rule and put a text (as a Welcome text in the beggining, then changed my mind and replaced it with just a
"website title"). I did this because i wanted to achieve to put the text ON TOP of the image in order to make it 
look like a real website logo. -->

<p>Nothing extremelly interesting is going to be seen here.. really.<br />
It's a  simple "CV Portfolio" webpage for an imaginary guy called "Gill Bates".. I hope you like the design however, as it's really what I had in mind.<br />
I tried to design this page using 3 different colors mostly, further than the 2 images, as my original thoughts regarding the whole design of the page was<br />
to try to keep it black, vivid (and thus the reason i have the music).. but mostly minimal.
All the photos that were used on this page are either edited by me, or.. it's simply me.</p>
