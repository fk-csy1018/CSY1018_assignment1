## Abstract

On this assignment our goal is to design and develop a Personal Webpage that consists of a 'starter' personal portfolio to support our future employability with the strictly use of HTML5 and CSS, while working our website on a simple text editor.

## Analysis

The way I implemented my website was done on steps.
Started by declaring the "Header" section of my page. The static content i need it to have on top of every page.
I include there the code for the music as it's not an element that will appear on page and I consider it as part of the header page.
However, this could be placed anywhere on the HTML file.

The Audio file (mp3) that I used is an Unlicensed mp3 (bensound-rumble.mp3) that i downloaded from
http://http://www.bensound.com/ . I put this on my page as a background music with the use of the default
HTML5 player and the attributes of autoplay in order to start on the background automatically during the time
that it takes for my page to load fully, plus loop in order to play nonstop (for those who enjoy the specific song).
I did use the ID of "bg_music" on the <audio> tag because I am planning to put some extra effort if <br>
there is time and give the use the ability to pause/stop the music with some buttons somewhere on site.
For now, since there are no buttons either, I have the "hidden" in order to just make it invisible on
page.
