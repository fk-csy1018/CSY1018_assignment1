<!-- The Audio file (mp3) that I used is an Unlicensed mp3 (bensound-rumble.mp3) that i downloaded from
http://http://www.bensound.com/ . I put this on my page as a background music with the use of the default
HTML5 player and the attributes of autoplay in order to start on the background automatically during the time
that it takes for my page to load fully, plus loop in order to play nonstop (for those who enjoy the specific song).
I did use the ID of "bg_music" on the <audio> tag because I am planning to put some extra effort if <br>
there is time and give the use the ability to pause/stop the music with some buttons somewhere on site.
For now, since there are no buttons either, I have the hidden="true" in order to just make it invisible on
page. -->
<audio id="bg_music" autoplay loop autobuffer="autobuffer" hidden="true">

<!-- I use the IMG html tag, with the characteristics of the class "logo" in order to set an image on the
top of my page as the logo of my website, and in order to make it look more like a "website logo" i created
an IMG class named as "logo" on my CSS and added few cool characteristics as the "border-radius: 50%;" so that
it adds that circle cut effect (that could alternativly do on an Image Editor and save the "around the circle"
area as a transparent background. I also added the position relative attribute in order to be able to use a 2nd
CSS rule and put a text (as a Welcome text in the beggining, then changed my mind and replaced it with just a
"website title"). I did this because i wanted to achieve to put the text ON TOP of the image in order to make it 
look like a real website logo. -->
<img class="logo" src="images/logo.png" /><br />
<!-- Text added on a <p> styled with some characteristics to make it look more like a logo, and placed above the image
that I use as my webpage's logo. I also used a font from "Google Fonts" in order to make it look a bit better. -->

<!-- I created my website's Navigation Bar as a list of elements (that work as links), then I make it act as a
Navigation Bar for my website by the use of CSS styles to make them arrange on the same raw with a specific appereance.
i set the ID of this to nav, so everything on this unordered list is going to get characteristics from the specific
styleset that I created for "nav" on my CSS file. --> 
	<ul class="w3-navbar w3-blue">
    <!-- I am Listing my Links one by one on as linked elements in order to create my Navigation bar. -->
    	<li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="bio.html">Bio</a></li>
        <li><a href="cv.html">CV</a></li>
        <li><a href="contact.html">Contact</a></li>
        <!-- List is complete, now the style in order to make that ordered list appear in 1 line as a navigation bar
        is already done through my CSS file, so I'm closing the ul tag and the section of it with </ul></div> -->
    </ul>

<!-- Added Horizontal Rule just for the style, to distinguish my main content from the footer.
And created the class footer on my CSS to add some extra attributes in order to place the HR always on the bottom of the page according
to the browser's window. -->
